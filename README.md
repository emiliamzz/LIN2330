This repo contains two Jupyter Notebooks:
- A [CNN](./CNN.ipynb) trained off of the [IMDB dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/%7Eamaas/data/sentiment/) for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.
- An [RNN](/RNN.ipynb) also trained off of the [IMDB dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/%7Eamaas/data/sentiment/) for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.

All codeblocks have been run and their outputs are present.
